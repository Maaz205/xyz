            <p>In the modern era, fashion has taken on a lot of significance, as it has become a big business and a social symbol. Girls have overtaken boys when it comes to fashion. If you go to any public place or event, where the presence of young boys and girls is significant, for example, a university or college, you will see boys walking around like dandies and girls like butterflies in their flashy, gorgeous and curious outfits </p>
